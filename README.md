**Currently a work-in-progress.**

# Requirements
- Unity 2021.3.16f1

# Third-Party Assets
- [MyBox](https://github.com/Deadcows/MyBox) - Unity Attribute extensions
- [TypeReference For Unity](https://github.com/SolidAlloy/ClassTypeReference-for-Unity) - Used for C# reflection.

## Optional - Used for (tool) development purposes
Not using these packages might cause some errors in the editor but is not used for game/logic code.
- [Hierarchy Dectorator](https://github.com/WooshiiDev/HierarchyDecorator) - Cosmetic changes to hierarchy tab
- [Debug Drawing Extensions](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/debug-drawing-extension-11396) - Used for debugging.
- [DebugGUI Graph](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/debuggui-graph-139275) - Used for debugging.

# Additional Credits
- [Touchable.cs script used for UI Buttons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36888780/how-to-make-an-invisible-transparent-button-work/64074858#64074858) - Ensures backfilling so transparent buttons still capture UI input events.
- [Kawase Blur](https://github.com/tomc128/urp-kawase-blur) - Used for UI blur background.
